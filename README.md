# electric-task1
this the first task for electric engineering path. 
to control and move the robotic arm that we all ready designed, we wil use electric mototrs between every junction in the arm. the motor should be senintive to degree so, we are going to use "Servo motor" with arduino to control the the movoment in the arm. 
this repesentary contains three main parts, the design of the circuit, the code needed to burn in arduino and compenants needed.
